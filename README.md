# DamPBN - now in ASCII

## Why?
Why not.  I originally alluded to this in the help for DamPBN, largely as a joke.  But then, I decided that it wouldn't be that bad.

## How to build?

All you need to build this is DOS and a copy of Watcom C.  I'm using Watcom 11, but I assume Open Watcom will work as well.  It has no other dependencies, so running 'build' at the root of the repo will build the binary.

## Controls

- Arrow keys - move the cursor around.  The play area will scroll if you move the cursor past the edge of an image larger than the play area.  
- Shift + arrow keys - move the cursor around one page at a time
- Space bar - fill in the square at the selected location.  If the square is filled in with the wrong color, clears the square entirely
[ / ] - move forward and backward through the color palette respectively
- O - options screen
- M - view an overview of the entire image progress
- K - toggle mark mode.  In mark mode, all squares of the current palette color will be highlighted with white text
- S - save progress
- L - load progress
- E - exit the game
